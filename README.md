## Demo of evaluation metrics

Functions for the  evaluation metrics used in the above study are collected in ```UQtools.py```.

Code for generating Figures 1-4 for the toy datasets introducing the evaluation metrics is collected in the following
colab link:

The following colab link calculates the uncertainty quantification (UQ) metrics and  generates the plots described in the paper for an example set of uncertainty+error pair.

## Models
Some of the models used in the study were published as part of this [paper](https://scipost.org/SciPostChem.2.1.002). These models can be found [here](https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/eUVFpTDU62) 
The remaining models can be found [here](https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/dNF1IjDPQB)

## Data
